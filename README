A simple "Hello World" project with Rails 3.1 and backbone

What I've done:

1. Added gems:

gem 'rails-backbone'
gem 'haml'
gem 'haml_coffee_assets', '~> 0.6.0'
gem 'execjs'

2. Set up backbone-rails (https://github.com/codebrew/backbone-rails):

rails g backbone install (creates app/assets/javascripts/backbone/..)

3. Generated a Rails scaffold (Car)

rails g scaffold Car make:string model:string

4. Generated backbone scaffold for Car

rails g backbone:scaffold Car make:string model:string

5. Added a placeholder div and Backbone init to cars/index
